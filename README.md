# Team-Builder
This Team Builder project will allow a user (like a Team Manager), to be able to easily build an HTML page that pleasantly displays a profile for themselves, along with members of their team, including other engineers and interns. The project is built around the user interaction with the console using inquirer and node js, and prompts the user w/ a series of questions to build profiles, as well as offering the user choices of what kind of profile to build, and upon finishing the team building, will provide the user with a generated HTML page to view their team's profiles with ease.
The team manager (user) can add as many engineers and inters as they want before finishing team building.
